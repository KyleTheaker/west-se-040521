# Object-Orientation: Inheritance 

## Objectives

- [ ] Define a class which inherits from another class using the `extends` keyword
- [ ] Use the `super` keyword to extend class
- [ ] Understand how inheritance can be used to reuse code, and provide new ways to use existing code.

```js
const person = {
    name: string,
    dob: string,
    greet: fn
}

const teacher = {
    name: string,
    dob: string
    jobTitle: string,
    greet: fn,
    teach: fn
}

const student = {
    name: string,
    dob: string,
    greet: fn,
    graduationDate: string,
    study: fn
}
```
