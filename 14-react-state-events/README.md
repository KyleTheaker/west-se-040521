# React-State-Events

## SWBATs

* Learn the difference between props and state, and why one would use one or the other
* Instantiate state in and out of the constructor
* Trigger rerenders by calling setState
* Manipulate the DOM by changing values in state
* Create event handler callbacks that manipulate state
* Know the difference between container and presentational components

## Imperative vs. Declarative
Imperative: telling how to do something
Declarative: telling *what* you want the outcome to me
